# MusicalStructureAppABSNGU
## Project 04


### Project Overview

This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned so far in this section of the Nanodegree program. 
You will be making the structure of a music app using Intents, New Activities, Arraylists, Loops and Custom Classes.
The goal is to design and layout the flow for the structure of a Music Player app. 
Note that for this project, the app does not actually need to play music. 
There are many music player apps, and they employ a wide variety of design choices. 
It will be your job to decide on the kind of structure that you would like your music app to have and build that structure using intents. 
Will you build an app to play music from the user’s library of music? Will you build an app to stream random songs from a database?
Will you build a musical suggestion engine? Those choices are up to you! 

### Why this project?

In the last portion of the Nanodegree program, you learned how to think about the structure of an app 
and how to use OnClickListeners and explicit Intents to link between different activities within your own app. 
You also learned how to loop through an ArrayList to retrieve and display information to a ListView. 
Practicing these skills will drastically improve the quality of the apps you build down the road. 

### What will I learn?

This project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

- Designing an app experience to achieve a certain goal
- Creating new activities
- Using explicit Intents to link between activities in your app
- Using OnClickListeners to add behavior to buttons using Java code.
- Creating your own Custom Class
- Looping through an ArrayList
- Populating a ListView or GridView with an ArrayAdapter

*Note:* As the focus of this program is Java, only projects completed with Java as the source code will be accepted.
Projects using Kotlin as the source code will not be accepted.
